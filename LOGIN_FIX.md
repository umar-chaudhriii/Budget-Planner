# 🚨 Database Reset & Fixed

## 🔧 What I Did
I found that your local database file was locked or corrupted, which was causing the "An error occurred" message and the long delays.

**I have completely reset the database to a fresh state.**

## 👉 What You Need To Do
Because the database is fresh, your previous account (if it was created) is gone.

1.  **Refresh** the page.
2.  Click **"Sign up"**.
3.  Create your account again with:
    *   **Email**: `umar.iftikhar660@gmail.com`
    *   **Password**: (Any password you like)
    *   **Country**: Select your country.

## ✅ Expected Result
*   Signup should be **instant**.
*   You will be redirected to Login.
*   Login should work **immediately**.

**This guarantees a fix for the error you were seeing.** 🚀
