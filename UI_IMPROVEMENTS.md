# ✨ UI Improvements

## 1. Better "Add Funds" for Goals
- **Old Way**: Ugly browser popup box.
- **New Way**: A sleek, modern modal window that pops up right in the app.
- **How to use**: Click "Add Funds" on any goal card. A nice window will appear asking for the amount.

## 2. Consistent "Export CSV" Button
- **Old Way**: Looked different from the other buttons.
- **New Way**: Now matches the "Import CSV" and other buttons perfectly (Gray style).
- **Location**: Transactions page, top right.

## Verification
1.  Go to **Goals** -> Click **Add Funds**. You should see the new modal.
2.  Go to **Transactions**. The **Export CSV** button should look identical to the **Import CSV** button next to it.
