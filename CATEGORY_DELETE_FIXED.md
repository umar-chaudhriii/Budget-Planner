# ✅ CATEGORY DELETE - FIXED!

## 🎉 **Problem Solved!**

The issue was that Chrome was **blocking `window.confirm()` popups** for localhost. This is a browser security feature.

---

## 🔧 **The Solution:**

I replaced the browser's `window.confirm()` dialog with a **custom modal dialog** that:
- ✅ Always appears (not blocked by browser)
- ✅ Looks beautiful and matches your app design
- ✅ Shows the category name being deleted
- ✅ Has clear Cancel and Delete buttons
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile

---

## 📋 **How It Works Now:**

### **To Delete a Category:**

1. Click the **red trash icon** next to any category
2. A **beautiful modal** appears asking for confirmation
3. Shows the category name: "Are you sure you want to delete **[Category Name]**?"
4. Click **"Delete"** to confirm or **"Cancel"** to abort
5. Category is deleted!
