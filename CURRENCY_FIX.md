# 💱 Currency Fix Applied

## What was wrong?
The **Subscriptions** and **Goals** pages were defaulting to **USD ($)** because they weren't checking your profile settings.

## What I fixed:
1.  **Subscriptions Page**: Now pulls your selected currency from your profile and displays it correctly for all costs.
2.  **Goals Page**: Now displays your savings targets and progress in your selected currency.

## 🔄 Verification:
1.  Refresh the page.
2.  Go to **Subscriptions** or **Goals**.
3.  You should see your currency symbol (e.g., `€`, `£`, `PKR`) instead of `$`.

**Note:** If you still see `$`, make sure your **Profile Settings** actually have a currency selected!
